    "1. Calculate the conversion and the Temperature as a function of time under the assumption that the reactor is operated under adiabatic conditions starting with a temperature of 298 K. \n",
    "2. Repeat the calculations for the heated reactor. Here the heating bed will generate a constant temperature of 398 K. Plot the conversion and temperature of the reactor as function of the time\n",
    "3. Repeat the calculations for the reactor without reaction, in other words show how the reactor and the reactor mixture would behave as function of time assuming that no reaction takes place.\n"
